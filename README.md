# HW Security Threat Knowledge Extraction

This repository provides a framework for **hardware security threat knowledge extraction** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It is designed to extract actionable insights on different categories of hardware security threats from research papers. The extracted knowledge can be used for various downstream applications such as threat modeling, design verification, and security-aware system development.

## Overview

The system uses a combination of vector-based retrieval and LLM-based generation to extract relevant information from a curated set of research papers. Currently, it supports two hardware security threat domains:

- **Information Leakage**
- **Side-Channel Attacks**

Each domain has its own embeddings, vector store, and output generation module.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (create one if needed).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the entire knowledge extraction pipeline:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

The outputs will be saved in the generated_outputs/ folder.

## Features
Modular RAG pipeline for different threat types

Custom embedding generation using FAISS

Easily extensible to add new hardware security threats or papers

Outputs are saved in simple .txt files for easy downstream processing
